# Project Charter

+ **Project Title:** Mastermemed
+ **Project Manager:** Riccardo Sartori
+ **Project Start:** 08 Mar 2020

## Reasons for Undertaking the Project

The reason this project is being made is to grow one or more Instagram meme pages. Once they've accumulated enough following, a plan to sell advertisements on them will start.

## Objectives and Constraints

The main objective of this project is to gather on at least one meme page enough of a following to advertise to, and generate some revenue. The revenue must eventually cover the budget spent on this project.

The each account will post a meme after a certain amount of time for approximately 8 hours a day. Each post will be selected randomly from a number of sources, and a single post cannot be posted to the same account twice. A website will be made where an administrator can check which memes are scheduled to be posted on which accounts, and it can be changed or modified from there.

## Risks

As Instagram has restricted their API behind a manual review, accessing the accounts will pose a challenge. This project cannot in any way be accepted by Instagram, as it is also against their Terms of Service, so one, some or all accounts taking part in this project may get banned.

Any other API necessary being unaccessible could pose a problem for this project.

## Budget

A â‚¬4/mo budget will be invested in this project to purchase hosting for the application. Additionally, a subfolder on my private website will be reserved for this application.
